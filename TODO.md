# TODO: Update Signup Screen Logo and Design

- [x] Remove the AppBar from SignupScreen
- [x] Add Scaffold body with Stack containing background image and dark overlay (same as login)
- [x] Add centered SingleChildScrollView with ConstrainedBox and Card (same as login)
- [x] Inside Card, add Padding, Form, and Column with logo, updated text ("Create Account", "Sign up to continue"), and form fields
- [x] Adjust form fields layout to match login (add SizedBox heights, etc.)
- [x] Update button styles to match login (FilledButton for Sign up, OutlinedButton for Login if needed, but since no login button, keep as is)
- [x] Fix import typo (uimport -> import)
